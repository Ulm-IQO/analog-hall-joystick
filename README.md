# Adjustable, Analog Hall Joystick

This joystick was designed to replace the failing resisitve joystick of a 
PI Micos SMC Corvus eco three-axis stepper motor controller.

The design has a primary XYZ joystick (Apem HF46S10) where the Z axis is 
the rotatable shaft and a secondary stick (Apem BF150A01BK0500) only 
for the Z axis.

Which Z axis is applied at the analog output can be controlled with a switch
while all four signals are available at the analog inputs of the integrated
Teensy 3.x microcontroller board.
